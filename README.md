# Project 3 - Scheduling Table

## Content Requirements (10pts)
Using your entire 2nd semester class schedule, create a time table that follows the exact same format as the one pictured below. 

![Schedule Table Example](https://github.com/paduawebdesign/P03-ClassSchedule/blob/master/SchedulePic.png "Schedule Table Example")

## Technical Requirements & Header Section (20pts)
* Use the full HTML structure - `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`
* Match the formatting pictured above; use italic and bold tags as appropriate
* Merge cells to show homeroom and flex across all 7 cycles
* Merge cells to show if you have first or second lunch
* Because this is a larger table, be sure to use `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` to structure your HTML

**HINT!** To give your table a border, add this to your opening `<table>` tag: `<table style="border:3px solid black;">` or `<table border="black">`

## Commenting & Readability (10pts)
* Use comments to put your name, the due date and program info at the top (under `<!DOCTYPE html>`)
* Have comments consistently throughout your HTML
* Correctly indent your code to make it easier to read
* Utilize whitespace to make your code easy to navigate

**Upload your assignment to GitHub and submit the RawGit link on OnCampus.**
